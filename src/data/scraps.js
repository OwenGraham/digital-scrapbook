    "releaseYear": 1970,
    "isbn": "0141441135",
    "review": "My second classic, after Dorian Grey. I could say lots more about this book than I can be bothered to write here. The beginning, and Maurice falling in love with Clive, was very sweet and relatable. Later parts of the story gave more social commentary than I expected, as I found with Dorian Grey. I particularily liked the afternote, and it's description of how the story ignored WW2 and was set in the last time when it was possible to \"run into the hills\" in England."

Ended up skipping lots of it again... mostly really tedious stuff like notes on translation. I did enjoy the longer more narrative bits though, and liked how it was written by in-world sources."
