    "review": "My second classic, after Dorian Grey. I could say lots more about this book than I can be bothered to write here. The beginning, and Maurice falling in love with Clive, was very sweet and relatable. Later parts of the story gave more social commentary than I expected, as I found with Dorian Grey. I particularily liked the afternote, and it's description of how the story ignored WW2 and was set in the last time when it was possible to \"run into the hills\" in England."

Of all the things I expected from this film, a feminist message about patriarchy in medieval times (still very applicable today) and listening to women's voices in rape cases wasn't one of them. I saw a review on Letterboxd dismissing it as a juvenile attempt at a \"what if we actually listened to women\" story but it's something I've never seen in the genre before and something I think is very needed",

The film was very slow, but I enjoyed Cillian Murphy, the setting (similar to Starve Acre in a way, I enjoy the familiarity), and the cinematography were great. However, I feel stupid to admit that I was pretty confused throughout the film and needed my mum to explain it afterwards, as I had never heard of the Magdalene Laundries. I think in a way I satisfied some of the motivation behind Cillian making this film as the debut of his studio, as when I got home I read the Wikipedia page for the Magdalene laundries and did some learning. Horrific stuff."
