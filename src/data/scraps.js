On paper I should love some films, but nothing sticks with me and few weeks after watching it's as if I never saw it at all, some films suprise me when i find myself thinking about them for a long time afterward, but this film latched it's self onto me straight away and I knew I'd be comparing so much else to it for a long time. Side note: Spike Lee always casts himself as the most loveable characters."

    "review": "My second classic, after Dorian Grey. I could say lots more about this book than I can be bothered to write here. The beginning, and Maurice falling in love with Clive, was very sweet and relatable. Later parts of the story gave more social commentary than I expected, as I found with Dorian Grey. I particularily liked the afternote, and it's description of how the story ignored WW2 and was set in the last time when it was possible to \"run into the hills\" in England."

Of all the things I expected from this film, a feminist message about patriarchy in medieval times (still very applicable today) and listening to women's voices in rape cases wasn't one of them. I saw a review on Letterboxd dismissing it as a juvenile attempt at a \"what if we actually listened to women\" story but it's something I've never seen in the genre before and something I think is very needed",

The film was very slow, but I enjoyed Cillian Murphy, the setting (similar to Starve Acre in a way, I enjoy the familiarity), and the cinematography were great. However, I feel stupid to admit that I was pretty confused throughout the film and needed my mum to explain it afterwards, as I had never heard of the Magdalene Laundries. I think in a way I satisfied some of the motivation behind Cillian making this film as the debut of his studio, as when I got home I read the Wikipedia page for the Magdalene laundries and did some learning. Horrific stuff."

Such a breath of fresh air to actually like and understand the choices of characters I'm meant to relate to in a film. The positive masculnity in this made me want to get the boys together to read eachother poems, and we'll all listen attentatively and aplaud one another. Wonderfully, I have friends who make this not a far cry. Also made me think I would make a great teacher, and I'm so lucky to have parents who encouraged me to do whatever I wanted. Martina recently told me I looked like Ethan Hawke in a photo, and it's becoming one of my favourite compliments."
