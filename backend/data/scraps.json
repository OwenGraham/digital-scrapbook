On paper I should love some films, but nothing sticks with me and few weeks after watching it's as if I never saw it at all, some films suprise me when i find myself thinking about them for a long time afterward, but this film latched it's self onto me straight away and I knew I'd be comparing so much else to it for a long time. Side note: Spike Lee always casts himself as the most loveable characters.","type":"FILM"},{"name":"Making Sense of the Troubles","img":"https://cdn.waterstones.com/bookjackets/large/9780/2419/9780241962657.jpg","author":"David McKittrick & David McVea","releaseYear":2001,"rating":3,"review":"Really really comprehensive and important and I'm so glad I read it, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a slog with all the similar acronyms and names.","type":"BOOK"},{"name":"Sling","img":"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0535/1453/5098/products/1_adff2fb1-b596-4e6d-a1b0-a76aa2179ad4.jpg?v=1626538459","artist":"Clairo","releaseYear":2021,"rating":3,"review":"Re-entering this data in a newer version of this app and I feel like I can't just copy across the old review for this because it was too rushed and apathetic and I've since grown to really love Clairo.

The beginning, and Maurice falling in love with Clive, was very sweet and relatable. Later parts of the story gave more social commentary than I expected, as I found with Dorian Grey. I particularily liked the afternote, and it's description of how the story ignored WW2 and was set in the last time when it was possible to \"run into the hills\" in England.","type":"BOOK"},{"name":"The Lord of the Rings: The Appendices","img":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330965881i/10807253.jpg","author":"J.R.R.

Of all the things I expected from this FILM, a feminist message about patriarchy in medieval times (still very applicable today) and listening to women's voices in rape cases wasn't one of them. I saw a review on Letterboxd dismissing it as a juvenile attempt at a \"what if we actually listened to women\" story but it's something I've never seen in the genre before and something I think is very needed","type":"FILM"},{"name":"The Godfather","img":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJkNGQyZDgtZDQ0NC00MDM0LWEzZWQtYzUzZDEwMDljZWNjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UY281_CR4,0,190,281_.jpg","director":"Francis Ford Coppola","releaseYear":1972,"rating":4,"review":"Finally got round to this now it's on streaming.

The film was very slow, but I enjoyed Cillian Murphy, the setting (similar to Starve Acre in a way, I enjoy the familiarity), and the cinematography were great. However, I feel stupid to admit that I was pretty confused throughout the film and needed my mum to explain it afterwards, as I had never heard of the Magdalene Laundries. I think in a way I satisfied some of the motivation behind Cillian making this FILM as the debut of his studio, as when I got home I read the Wikipedia page for the Magdalene laundries and did some learning. Horrific stuff.","type":"FILM"},{"name":"Taxi Driver","img":"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQS_MWAGYS7qxHX4bwKT0TyTrJ6mB6V1DYrarKoOvjw2gvnGly7T5-Pt6B_uH7HOZd-O_KP","director":"Martin Scorsese","releaseYear":1976,"rating":4,"review":"A meadering and uneventful plot driven by captivating characters and iconic visuals, my favourite genre.

Wonderfully, I have friends who make this not a far cry. Also made me think I would make a great teacher, and I'm so lucky to have parents who encouraged me to do whatever I wanted.

It was sometimes painfully on-the-nose and swaying between I'm 14 and this is deep and That Mitchell and Webb Look's emergency broadcast gameshow, but this could just be an effect of how prophetic it turned out to be. I found the more nuanced themes like sex and philology helped soften this too, for example contrast Winston and Julia's time in the glade to the excutiating exerpts from Goldstein's manifesto which I probably would have expected to like more. It also weirdly read a lot like Dune with the huge dumps of inner monologue and perspective, as well as the retro-futuristic elements. One thing I kept thinking throughout was why would anyone not want to just be a prole? Their lives sound infinitely better. Overall though, I'd say my opinion of the government hasn't changed much.","type":"BOOK"},{"name":"Boomtown","img":"https://media.timeout.com/images/106211055/image.jpg","date":[2025,8,6],"venue":"Matterley Estate ","lineup":["fuckin loads of people"],"type":"EVENT"},{"name":"ICONS by Virgil Abloh","img":"https://media.endclothing.com/media/f_auto,q_auto:eco,w_768/prodmedia/media/catalog/product/2/0/20-04-2021_BLR_978-3-8365-8509-5_m1_1.jpg","brand":"Nike","price":45,"link":"https://www.endclothing.com/gb/nike-icons-by-virgil-abloh-978-3-8365-8509-5.html?srsltid=AfmBOooDeH0DEAqGNnOSdQlyX_5haattvFwH05IgxsZkDRFvwl6ZcqWI","type":"WISHLIST"},{"name":"Babylon","img":"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQVOnLqrGK5kEnfesIZXfWFsq0bBU7tNuFGZzwspBCdz72TuRsjw2g5LSQySsLk77mgUjVANw","director":"Franco Rosso","releaseYear":1980,"rating":5,"review":"I had a feeling this would become an instant favourite and I was right but come one, soundsystems, dub sirens, commentary on race and policing, british accents, the COSTUMES man.
